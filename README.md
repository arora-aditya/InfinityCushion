# SmartStudyMonitor
Project for ECE150 2017

Here's an initial draft outline that should have more details filled in over the weekend:
 
### Project Overview
  - What is the project about?
  - What would you have liked it to do if it could do everything
  - What subset does it do?

### System Design
  - What is the complete system design: hardware and software
  - identify all components

### Software Design
  Identify all source code files (.cpp, .h, makefile, anything else required to build the source code)
  State machine diagrams, if any
  Function call tree
  Classes and/or Structs
    - interface definition
      - what each data element represents
      - what each method represents
  System-independent components
  System-dependent components
  Logging infrastructure

## Additional aspects

### Testing
  Identify how you know your system does what it claims to do

### Limitations
  - What doesn't your project do (that it might be expected to do)?

### Lessons Learned
  - Reflect on your project: what would you do differently if you were starting it again?

### Appendix
  Source code
  Peer contribution
